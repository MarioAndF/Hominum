>*Biological database of the human body*

This project is about collecting, organizing and structuring details about the biology of the human body. This creates a complete database that can be used to study, review, and develop related proyects.

## Features

The complete database contains most details about the human body and is currently still in development. It is organized by a regional and a systemic review of the body. It has been indexed according to *"Terminologia Anatomica"* nomenclature published in 1998 and stored in markdown (.md) files to allow easy readability and editability.

## Usage

You can open the file [**Data.md**](./Data.md) and review details about any part of the body. Since there are thousand of terms in the file, you can use [**RegionalIndex.md**](./RegionalIndex.md) or [**SystemicIndex.md**](./SystemicIndex.md) to browse and search through different parts of the human body. This database will power in the future the webpage https://hominum.info and the *Hominum* app for a greater user experience.

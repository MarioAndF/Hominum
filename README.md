*Homo sapiens biological and medical database*


This projectÂ´s goal is to collect, organize and structurize details about the biology of the human species. This creates a complete database that can be used to study, review, and derivative projects.

The complete database is currently a working progress. It is stored in multiple .markdown files to allow easy readability and editability.
